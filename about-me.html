                <p class="text">
                    Hi there, my name is Aflal, and I am an undergraduate final year Computer Science student at Kings College London. 
                    <br><br>
                    Programming has been my growing passion, ever since I built my first basic website. My degree has assisted me to 
                    build my programming skills and to learn many advantageous practices of coding.  
                    <br><br>
                    Since my initial exposure to programming, I have acquired knowledge on several programming languages and have 
                    worked on multiple software projects which has further built and solidified my comprehension of the constructs 
                    in the language used.
                    <br><br>
                    Surprisingly ðŸ˜‰, I do enjoy doing other activities other than programming. I appreciate an occasional gaming 
                    session; I am currently in love with Super Mario Odyssey. Infrequently, I go out with my fellow nerds, watch 
                    a movie together and discuss about a few nerdy stuff ðŸ˜‰. Physical activities that I engage myself in, 
                    includes; working out in the gym and playing cricket. Besides, I also enjoy an occasional pool or snooker 
                    session with my friends.  
                    <br><br>
                    Large scale projects that often scale for a few weeks, tend to captivate my leisure. Usually, these projects 
                    tend to be of me building workstation grade and gaming computers, and sometimes fixing them. I also enjoy 
                    trying out new computer hardware and going hands-on with striking newly-released tech gadgets. 
                </p>
                <h3 class="title">What do I do other than programming and working on projects?</h3>
                <p class="text">
                        Well, I teach others to code. I know, I am revolving in this programming bubble. I teach and train 
                        college students to code. Most of these students are exposed to coding by me, and therefore I help 
                        them to build their first â€˜Hello Worldâ€™ application ðŸ˜‰. Of course, the Hello World application is 
                        just to start off, I guide the students through building their first website. In the last workshop 
                        that I led, I helped the students to build their portfolio website using HTML, CSS and some 
                        JavaScript for interactivity, hence, giving them a platform to present their work.
                        <br><br>
                        My passion for web development enables me to undertake similar workshops whereas my enthusiasm 
                        in this field engages students greatly in my presentations. Every student at the end has a 
                        working portfolio website, an intriguing interest on web development and students leave with 
                        a keen interest on web development, which ultimately motivates me to do more.
